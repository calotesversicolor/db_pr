CREATE VIEW v_persons_male AS SELECT gender FROM person
WHERE gender='male';
```


## Exercise 01 - From parts to common view

## Exercise 02 - “Store” generated dates in one place

```sql
CREATE VIEW  v_generated_dates AS SELECT days::date 
FROM generate_series ('2022-01-01', '2022-01-31', interval '1 day') AS days

SELECT * FROM v_generated_dates
ORDER BY v_generated_dates;

## Exercise 03 - Find missing visit days with Database View

```sql
SELECT days FROM v_generated_dates
FULL JOIN person_visits ON v_generated_dates.days = person_visits.visit_date 
WHERE person_id IS NULL;

## Exercise 04 - Let’s find something from Set Theory

```sql
CREATE VIEW  v_symmetric_union AS SELECT person_visits.id FROM person_visits
RIGHT JOIN ((SELECT visit_date FROM person_visits
WHERE visit_date = '2022-01-02'
EXCEPT
SELECT visit_date FROM person_visits
WHERE visit_date = '2022-01-06')
UNION
(SELECT visit_date FROM person_visits
WHERE visit_date = '2022-01-06'
EXCEPT
SELECT visit_date FROM person_visits
WHERE visit_date = '2022-01-02')) AS u ON person_visits.visit_date = u.visit_date;
```


## Exercise 05 - Let’s calculate a discount price for each person

```sql
CREATE VIEW v_price_with_discount AS SELECT name, pizza_name, price, (price - price*0.1) AS discount_price FROM person_order
JOIN person ON person.id = person_order.person_id
JOIN menu ON  menu.id = person_order.menu_id
ORDER BY pizza_name, name;

SELECT * FROM v_price_with_discount;
```

## Exercise 06 - Materialization from virtualization

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_dmitriy_visits_and_eats AS SELECT pizzeria.name FROM person_visits pv
JOIN person ON person.id = pv.person_id
JOIN pizzeria ON pizzeria.id = pv.pizzeria_id
JOIN menu ON menu.pizzeria_id = pizzeria.id
WHERE person.name = 'Dmitriy' AND price < 800 AND visit_date = '2022-01-08'
```


## Exercise 07 - Refresh our state

```sql
INSERT INTO person_visits VALUES (20, 9, 3, '2022-01-08');

REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_dmitriy_visits_and_eats;
SELECT * FROM mv_dmitriy_visits_and_eats;
```
